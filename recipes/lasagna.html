    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty, vegetable lasagna is the only lasagna my husband will eat. We love it! Hope you all enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</ul>
    <ul>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</ul>
    <ul>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper</ul>
    <ul>3 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
    <ul>2 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon dried basil</ul>
    <ul>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</ul>
    <ul>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</ul>
    <ul>2 eggs</ul>
    <ul>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </ul>
    <br/>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol> Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.
    </ol>
    <ol>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.
    </ol>
    <ol>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</ol>
    <ol>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.
    </ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
